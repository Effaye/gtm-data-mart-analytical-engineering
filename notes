1. This analytic mart is to create a high-level view of:
- sales channel efficiency overview (CAC, ROI etc), to better plan the channel budget
- areas for improvement, including:
  - for account managers
  - for marketing target strategies (ideal customer profile)

  > how to convert the with least money
  > what accounts need to be targeted
  > how to find the ideal customers
  > what accounts need to be prioritized

  To prioritize, I want them to be able to see:
  - market channel overview: traffic, conversion, 
  - few action points: how to allocate budget, what channels should be adjusted, whether we're finding the ideal customers and what account/opportunities should be prioritized.

To see how well your marketing is doing, you need to check a few things:

Sales: Are you making money from your marketing?

Getting Leads: Is your marketing getting people interested?

Keeping Customers: Are customers sticking around?

Nurturing Leads: Are you taking care of potential customers?

Brand Awareness: Is your brand getting known?

Engagement: Are people engaging with your marketing?

To see if your marketing is profitable, use this formula: (Money you make - Money spent on marketing) / Money spent on marketing.

This shows if you're making more money than you're spending. Connecting marketing to revenue is key to understanding its impact on your bottom line in our data-driven marketing world.
